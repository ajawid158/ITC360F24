I have stayed in this hotel many times over many years and always found it excellent. Although I appreciate you have lost a great deal of income because of covid trying to recoup it in the way you are is very stupid.,2.5
I called reception to book my hotel and Carlston provided me complete overview along with COvid 19 restrictions. This helped in booking and planning my trip. On site it was showing occupied although rooms with kid option were available.,4.5
Wife and I have been staying here for years during annual our vacations and we are treated like family.,5
"Nice place, very good to stay. 7 euro a day parking right under the hotel is ideal. Good breakfast with everything you might want to eat.12 Euros is quite expensive though.",5
Very efficient staff working in difficult conditions due to covid19. Hotel kept very clean. We have stayed in many Ibis hotels and have never been disappointed. Well done Ibis Koblenz City and Ibis hotels in general!!!,5
Terrible reception service,1
We have been here for 5 days now and have still some more days to go. The place is well situated; bus and railway station about 5 minutes walk. Shopping areas at reasonable walking distances.,5
"Rooms do not have airco like Trivago states, this is not the hotel fault but still a bummer when it is 37 during the say and 24 during the night.",3
"This is a real jewel. It is close to the center of Koblenz and the train station. It is very quiet, clean, and well managed. Reasonably priced. Large bedrooms and efficient bathrooms. Receptionists are friendly and helpful. I have come here for more than four years whenever I come to Koblenz.",5
"Very convenient location, between the station and the city centre, tidy and clean, chance to park underground (for a fee). I used only accommodation",5
The beds were very comfortable and the rooms tidy and clean. The food was good. But as soon as we stepped into the hallway leading to our rooms it was obvious there had been smokers inside the rooms. Despite signs saying no smoking. This turned into a night from hell. We coughed and choked and our throats burned. We had to leave the window wide open to be able to sleep. Which in mid winter is pretty cold. Not to mention the very loud street noise and the roar of the trains that went past every 20 mins. By morning I was sick and had no voice like I had spent the night smoking. Thanks for the headache.,3
Good parking and locatioin,3
Enjoyed a good stay here...Starting with a very good breakfast. Friendly people. Excellent location from Koblenz Hbf less than 10mins walk.,5
Friendly reception and wonderful location 10mins far away from Hauptbahnhof.,5
"Breakfast delicious, room below the average (Wi-Fi was off, nobody knew when will be back) but clean.",3
We arrived by train well before check -in time for a one-night stop at the end of our holiday. We soon had our luggage locked away and spent a pleasant afternoon exploring the city. After a comfortable nights sleep we enjoyed a good breakfast and left for the train to Frankfurt and our flight home.,3
"Very minimalist , not even Kleenex. The room and bath were clean. Towels very thin and with exception to a tube of all purpose liquid soap at sink and about a quarter of one in the shower that was it. The staff was very helpful!",3
Nice and clean hotel with everything what we needed: nice bar and good breakfast and clean rooms & friendly staff !,5
"I really liked how the hotel was close to the train station, which as a plus for me and my boyfriend. It was really easy to find, and the information desk knew exactly where it was!",4
"Hotel staff recommended a great German pub close by, the food was great. They will keep your luggage for secured few of charge on the day you check in/out. Free wifi throughout the hotel. The room is very spacious for European standard.",5
Good bed and breakfast. For a dinner you will find good restaurant close to the hotel.,3
"Cheap, small rooms, 5th floor hallway reeked or ciggarettes. Staff was friendly and attentive. Good breakfast. The rooms seemed pretty clean.",3
"Located in the heart of city.Thats the point  Nice, very comfortable hotel",5
"Breakfast, which was not included in the price was good. Else the room was as tidy as it was tiny. No extras whatsoever, no mini bar, no safe, not even a nessecaire, toothbrush or anything. Ok for the night but all in all not worth the price. Others while cheaper offer better quality, but we're already booked out. It's obvious why.",3
Very basic but clean and tidy. No kettle though. But for a cheap sleep this place is perfec,4
Hotel rooms good. Evening drink collection is good. Morning breakfast also good.,4
"We booked Ibis hotel because we thought they had everything we need, especially internet. But at that time we stayed, the internet is not working. Disappointed.",3
